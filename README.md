âœ‹Airâ€‘Calc: Hand Gesture Calculator

  Airâ€‘Calc is a real-time, webcam-based calculator that lets you perform arithmetic using just your fingers. No keyboard input needed â€” simply show your hands to      the camera, and it detects numbers using finger count with MediaPipe!
  Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, this project demonstrates how computer vision can be used to create touchless, interactive systems.
